# CONTEXT — TrackFlow (Business Performance Pipeline)


## 1. The business deliverable

Thomas (CEO) wants a **weekly report** he can open without calling Ana or Miguel, comparing how each warehouse is performing per client — the thing his directors currently spend hours assembling by hand every Sunday night.

> **Target deliverable:** a weekly, per-warehouse, per-client rollup of throughput, stockout activity, and inventory accuracy — the "Weekly Warehouse & Client Performance Report."

This is the **one concrete deliverable** your pipeline exists to produce. Everything in your `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` should trace back to it.

**Audience:** Thomas (CEO) and Ana (Head of Warehouse Operations) — non-technical stakeholders who need numbers, not raw events.
**Cadence:** weekly (fresh as of Monday morning, matching the existing "automated weekly executive report" expectation leadership already has).

## 2. KPIs to Measure

**These are the KPIs this pipeline exists to produce.** Everything else in this document — source events, aggregation logic, table schema — is implementation detail in service of these four numbers. If you're unsure what to build next, come back to this list.

| KPI                        | What it measures                                                                                     | Why it matters to TrackFlow                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inbound Volume**           | How many units of a client's goods a warehouse received during the week.                                | Shows incoming workload per warehouse and client — the basis for capacity planning (Ana).                    |
| **Outbound Throughput**      | How many orders a warehouse picked and dispatched for a client during the week.                          | The processing-capacity signal — how much a warehouse is actually able to move, not just receive.            |
| **Stockout Frequency**       | How many times during the week a client's SKU at a warehouse fell below the configured minimum.          | An early warning before a client-facing stockout occurs — Miguel needs this to manage client expectations.    |
| **Discrepancy Rate**         | The share of the week's outbound orders associated with a detected inventory discrepancy.                | The inventory-accuracy signal — flags which warehouse/client combinations need an audit.                     |

Everything below this point exists only to compute these four numbers correctly, reliably, and auditable.

## 3. Source data

Your source is `telemetry_events`, filtered to the mandatory metrics already defined in your telemetry CONTEXT:

| `event_type`                     | Feeds which KPI(s)                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `inbound_order_created`            | Inbound Volume                                  |
| `outbound_order_created`           | Outbound Throughput, Discrepancy Rate (denominator) |
| `stock_threshold_triggered`        | Stockout Frequency                              |
| `inventory_discrepancy_detected`   | Discrepancy Rate (numerator)                    |


---

## 4. Required aggregation

- **Grain:** one row per `warehouse` per `client_id` per ISO week (`week_start` = the Monday of that week, UTC).
- **Dimensions:** `warehouse` (`los_angeles`/`zaragoza`), `client_id`, `week_start`.
- **Computed fields per row (each maps directly to a KPI from section 2):**
  - `inbound_units_count` — Inbound Volume: sum of quantities from `inbound_order_created` for the week
  - `outbound_orders_count` — Outbound Throughput: count of `outbound_order_created` for the week
  - `stockout_events_count` — Stockout Frequency: count of `stock_threshold_triggered` for the week
  - `discrepancy_events_count` — supporting count of `inventory_discrepancy_detected` for the week
  - `discrepancy_rate` — Discrepancy Rate: `discrepancy_events_count / outbound_orders_count` (0 if no orders that week)

There is no currency dimension here — this deliverable is operational (volume and accuracy), not cost-based.

## 5. Destination table

Create this table under a dedicated `reporting` schema — never write into `telemetry_events`:

```sql
create table reporting.weekly_warehouse_client_performance (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  warehouse text not null,
  client_id text not null,
  week_start date not null,
  inbound_units_count integer not null default 0,
  outbound_orders_count integer not null default 0,
  stockout_events_count integer not null default 0,
  discrepancy_events_count integer not null default 0,
  discrepancy_rate numeric not null default 0,
  computed_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  unique (warehouse, client_id, week_start)
);
```

The `unique (warehouse, client_id, week_start)` constraint is what your idempotency strategy (upsert) should rely on.

---

## 6. New reporting endpoint

Expose this pipeline's output through a **new** module, `services/reporting/`, separate from `services/telemetry/`:

- `GET /reporting/weekly-warehouse-client-performance` — accepts optional `week_start` (defaults to the most recent computed week); returns all warehouse/client combinations for that week:

```json
{
  "week_start": "2026-07-13",
  "entries": [
    {
      "warehouse": "los_angeles",
      "client_id": "fashion-co",
      "inbound_units_count": 4200,
      "outbound_orders_count": 980,
      "stockout_events_count": 3,
      "discrepancy_events_count": 2,
      "discrepancy_rate": 0.002
    }
  ]
}
```

- `GET /reporting/pipeline-runs/latest` — status and metadata of the last pipeline run (this can be the same pattern you'll reuse for any future pipeline).
- `POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` — triggers a manual run.

---

## 7. Business constraints

- Each row belongs to a single client — never aggregate across clients within the same row.
- This pipeline reads `telemetry_events` **read-only**. It never writes back to it.
- `services/telemetry/analysis.py` and `GET /telemetry/report` are out of scope for this milestone — do not modify them.
