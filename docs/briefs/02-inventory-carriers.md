# Brief: Inventory & Carrier Scoring Engine

## Client: TrackFlow · Stakeholder: Ana Whitfield (Head of Warehouse Operations)

## About TrackFlow

TrackFlow is a last-mile delivery and warehouse management company operating in the United States (Los Angeles) and Spain (Zaragoza). The company manages warehouses for e-commerce brands and handles the final delivery to end customers. You're part of TrackFlow Tech, the internal unit leading the company's digital transformation.

## Your Assignment

Ana Whitfield needs you to build the core data processing logic for TrackFlow's warehouse and carrier management systems. Currently, warehouse managers and logistics coordinators handle everything manually — tracking inventory, scoring carriers, calculating shipping costs, and managing order fulfillment. This milestone focuses on building the TypeScript functions that will power inventory control and carrier selection.

This is pure programming — no AI, no prompting. Ana needs reliable code that won't break when processing thousands of orders per day.

## What You're Building

You will implement a set of TypeScript utilities to:

- Model shipment, inventory, and carrier data using interfaces
- Filter and search inventory by SKU, location, and stock levels
- Score carriers based on cost, speed, and reliability
- Calculate shipping costs based on weight, distance, and carrier rates
- Generate warehouse reports with aggregated metrics
- Validate data before processing orders

## Business Entities

### Product

Represents a product stored in TrackFlow's warehouses.

**Interface: Product**

```typescript
interface Product {
  sku: string; // Stock Keeping Unit (e.g., "SHOE-BLK-42")
  name: string; // Product name
  category: ProductCategory; // Product category
  weightKg: number; // Weight in kilograms
  dimensions: Dimensions; // Length, width, height in cm
  warehouse: WarehouseLocation; // Current warehouse
  stockQuantity: number; // Available units
  minStockThreshold: number; // Minimum stock before alert
  unitCostUSD: number; // Cost per unit in USD
  isFragile: boolean; // Requires special handling
  status: ProductStatus; // Current status
}

interface Dimensions {
  lengthCm: number;
  widthCm: number;
  heightCm: number;
}

type ProductCategory =
  | "Fashion"
  | "Electronics"
  | "Cosmetics"
  | "Home"
  | "Other";
type WarehouseLocation = "Los Angeles" | "Zaragoza";
type ProductStatus = "Active" | "Low stock" | "Out of stock" | "Discontinued";
```

**Validation Rules:**

- `sku` must not be empty
- `weightKg` must be > 0 and <= 100
- All dimensions must be > 0 and <= 200
- `stockQuantity` must be >= 0
- `minStockThreshold` must be >= 0
- `unitCostUSD` must be > 0

### Shipment

Represents a delivery order that needs to be shipped to a customer.

**Interface: Shipment**

```typescript
interface Shipment {
  id: string; // Unique shipment ID (e.g., "SH-2024-8821")
  sku: string; // Product SKU being shipped
  quantity: number; // Number of units
  origin: WarehouseLocation; // Origin warehouse
  destination: Destination; // Delivery destination
  priority: ShipmentPriority; // Urgency level
  declaredValueUSD: number; // Declared value for insurance
  carrier: string | null; // Assigned carrier (null if not assigned)
  status: ShipmentStatus; // Current status
  createdAt: Date; // Order creation date
}

interface Destination {
  city: string;
  country: Country;
  postalCode: string;
  distanceKm: number; // Distance from origin warehouse
}

type Country = "United States" | "Spain";
type ShipmentPriority = "Standard" | "Express" | "Same-day";
type ShipmentStatus =
  | "Pending"
  | "Assigned"
  | "In transit"
  | "Delivered"
  | "Failed";
```

**Validation Rules:**

- `quantity` must be > 0
- `declaredValueUSD` must be > 0
- `distanceKm` must be >= 0

### Carrier

Represents a delivery carrier that TrackFlow works with.

**Interface: Carrier**

```typescript
interface Carrier {
  id: string; // Carrier ID (e.g., "CAR-UPS")
  name: string; // Carrier name (e.g., "UPS")
  operatesIn: Country[]; // Countries where they operate
  baseRateUSD: number; // Base delivery cost (USD)
  ratePerKgUSD: number; // Additional cost per kg (USD)
  ratePerKmUSD: number; // Additional cost per km (USD)
  avgDeliveryDays: number; // Average delivery time in days
  onTimeRate: number; // On-time delivery rate (0-100)
  maxWeightKg: number; // Maximum package weight they accept
  handlesFragile: boolean; // Can handle fragile items
  acceptsPriority: ShipmentPriority[]; // Priorities they support
}
```

**Validation Rules:**

- `baseRateUSD`, `ratePerKgUSD`, `ratePerKmUSD` must all be >= 0
- `avgDeliveryDays` must be > 0
- `onTimeRate` must be between 0 and 100
- `maxWeightKg` must be > 0
- `operatesIn` must contain at least 1 country

### InventoryMovement

Tracks inventory changes (inbound or outbound).

**Interface: InventoryMovement**

```typescript
interface InventoryMovement {
  id: string; // Movement ID
  sku: string; // Product SKU
  warehouse: WarehouseLocation; // Warehouse location
  type: MovementType; // Inbound or outbound
  quantity: number; // Number of units moved
  reason: string; // Reason for movement
  timestamp: Date; // When it happened
}

type MovementType = "Inbound" | "Outbound" | "Transfer" | "Adjustment";
```

## Required Functions

Implement these functions in the appropriate files according to the structure in the README.

### 1. Collection Operations (`src/utils/collections.ts`)

- `filterProductsByWarehouse(products: Product[], warehouse: WarehouseLocation): Product[]`
  - Returns products in the specified warehouse
- `filterProductsByCategory(products: Product[], category: ProductCategory): Product[]`
  - Returns products in the specified category
- `filterLowStockProducts(products: Product[]): Product[]`
  - Returns products where `stockQuantity <= minStockThreshold`
- `sortProductsByStock(products: Product[], order: "asc" | "desc"): Product[]`
  - Returns products sorted by stock quantity
  - Should not mutate the original array
- `sortCarriersByReliability(carriers: Carrier[], order: "asc" | "desc"): Carrier[]`
  - Returns carriers sorted by on-time rate
  - Should not mutate the original array

### 2. Search Operations (`src/utils/search.ts`)

- `findProductBySKU(products: Product[], sku: string): Product | null`
  - Performs linear search to find a product by SKU
  - SKU comparison should be case-insensitive
  - Returns the product if found, null otherwise
- `findShipmentById(shipments: Shipment[], id: string): Shipment | null`
  - Performs linear search to find a shipment by ID
  - Returns the shipment if found, null otherwise
- `binarySearchProductByWeight(sortedProducts: Product[], targetWeight: number): number`
  - Assumes the array is already sorted by weight (ascending)
  - Performs binary search to find the index of a product with the target weight
  - Returns the index if found, -1 otherwise

### 3. Carrier Scoring and Cost Calculation (`src/utils/transformations.ts`)

- `calculateShippingCost(shipment: Shipment, product: Product, carrier: Carrier): number`

  Calculates the total shipping cost based on:

  - Base rate: `carrier.baseRateUSD`
  - Weight cost: `product.weightKg * carrier.ratePerKgUSD * shipment.quantity`
  - Distance cost: `shipment.destination.distanceKm * carrier.ratePerKmUSD`
  - Priority surcharge:
    - Standard: 0% additional
    - Express: +30%
    - Same-day: +60%
  - Returns total cost rounded to 2 decimal places

- `scoreCarrierForShipment(carrier: Carrier, shipment: Shipment, product: Product): number`

  Calculates a suitability score (0-100) for a carrier based on:

  - **Operates in destination country (20 points):**
    - +20 if carrier operates in shipment's destination country
    - 0 otherwise
  - **Can handle weight (20 points):**
    - +20 if `product.weightKg * shipment.quantity <= carrier.maxWeightKg`
    - 0 otherwise
  - **Supports priority (15 points):**
    - +15 if carrier accepts the shipment's priority level
    - 0 otherwise
  - **Handles fragile (15 points):**
    - +15 if product is fragile and carrier handles fragile items
    - +15 if product is not fragile
    - 0 if product is fragile but carrier doesn't handle fragile
  - **Reliability (30 points):**
    - Points = carrier's `onTimeRate * 0.3`
    - (e.g., 90% on-time rate = 27 points)
  - Returns score rounded to 2 decimal places

- `selectBestCarrier(carriers: Carrier[], shipment: Shipment, product: Product): {carrier: Carrier, score: number, cost: number} | null`
  - Scores all carriers for the shipment
  - Filters out carriers with score < 50 (unsuitable)
  - Among suitable carriers, selects the one with the lowest cost
  - Returns the best carrier with its score and cost, or null if no suitable carrier found

### 4. Aggregations and Reports (`src/utils/transformations.ts`)

- `countProductsByCategory(products: Product[]): Record<ProductCategory, number>`
  - Returns a count of products for each category
- `calculateTotalInventoryValue(products: Product[]): number`
  - Returns the total value of all inventory
  - Formula: sum of (`stockQuantity * unitCostUSD`) for all products
  - Round to 2 decimal places
- `calculateAverageShipmentDistance(shipments: Shipment[]): number`
  - Returns the average distance across all shipments
  - Round to 2 decimal places
- `groupShipmentsByStatus(shipments: Shipment[]): Record<ShipmentStatus, Shipment[]>`
  - Groups shipments by status
  - Returns an object where keys are statuses and values are arrays of shipments
- `findTopCarriers(shipments: Shipment[], topN: number): Array<{carrier: string, count: number}>`
  - Finds the N most used carriers based on assigned shipments
  - Ignores shipments with null carrier
  - Returns them sorted by usage count (highest first)
  - Each element contains carrier name and shipment count

### 5. Validations (`src/utils/validations.ts`)

- `validateProduct(product: Product): { valid: boolean, errors: string[] }`
  - Validates all business rules for a product
  - Returns an object with:
    - `valid`: true if all validations pass, false otherwise
    - `errors`: array of error messages (empty if valid)
- `validateShipment(shipment: Shipment): { valid: boolean, errors: string[] }`
  - Validates all business rules for a shipment
  - Returns an object with:
    - `valid`: true if all validations pass, false otherwise

## Acceptance Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated on:

- **Type Safety:** All interfaces defined correctly with appropriate types
- **Function Correctness:** Each function produces the expected output for the given inputs
- **Edge Case Handling:** Functions handle empty arrays, null values, and invalid data gracefully
- **Validation Logic:** Business rules are enforced accurately
- **Code Organization:** Functions are in the correct files according to responsibility
- **Naming Conventions:** Variables, functions, and types follow TypeScript conventions
- **No Mutations:** Sorting and filtering functions don't modify the original arrays
- **Pure Functions:** Functions only work with parameters, no global variables

## What Ana Expects

> "Listen, we process 2,000+ shipments per week across both warehouses. I can't have your code breaking when there's a null value or an edge case. Write it like it's going into production tomorrow — because it is. Make it solid, make it testable, and make it maintainable."
