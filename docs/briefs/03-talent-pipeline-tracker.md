## Your company

You are part of the **TrackFlow Tech** team, the internal technology unit of TrackFlow, a last-mile delivery and warehouse management company with operations in Los Angeles and Zaragoza. The team is in the middle of a digital transformation and every tool you build has a direct impact on the next day's operations.

## The assignment

Ana Whitfield, Head of Warehouse Operations, has sent the following email with Andrés Kim, CTO, on copy:

> **To:** Andrés Kim (CTO)
> **CC:** TrackFlow Tech Team
> **Subject:** URGENT — Candidate management tool — needed now
>
> Andrés,
>
> I'm copying the tech team directly because this cannot wait any longer. We are managing the **Executive Assistant** selection process for the Zaragoza headquarters in an Excel file that nobody has under control. We have over a hundred applications, three people touching the same file, and this morning we discovered that someone overwrote the notes from two interviews last week.
>
> Javier confirmed to me yesterday that the backend is live. I need someone from the team to build the frontend this week. The selection process cannot stop.
>
> What I need:
>
> - See all candidates at a glance: name, position, status, and stage.
> - Filter by status and stage, and search by name or email without reloading the page.
> - Open a candidate's detail and update their status or stage from there.
> - Add notes after calls and interviews, and delete them when they're no longer needed.
> - Register candidates who come through other channels and edit data when it arrives incorrectly.
>
> Thank you,
> Ana
